# Snake
## Overview
I coded a snake clone inspired by the good old nokia phones of my youth. Please feel free to check it out. I'd be glad for any input. I'm just glad it works :-)
## Setup instructions
Nothing much. But for non windows-users: you may have to check the console-beeps. I'm unsure if the overload i used for the beep-method can be used by other operating systems than windows.
